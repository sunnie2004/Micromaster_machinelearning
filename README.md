##1. Automatic Review Analysis <br>
The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. <br>
Implemented and compared three types of linear classifiers to use for sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. <br>
Three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.<br>
1> Convert review texts into feature vectors using a bag of words approach. <br>
bag_of_words function in project1.py  takes the raw data(train_data) and returns dictionary of unigram words.<br> 
2> The resulting dictionary is an input to extract_bow_feature_vectors which computes a feature matrix of ones and zeros that can be used as the input for the classification algorithms. <br>
3> Using the feature matrix and learning algorithms to compute  theta and theta_0 <br>
What did I do?<br>
functons:<br>
1> Hinge Loss 2> Perceptron Algorithm 3> Pegasos Algorithm 4> main.py

##2. Digit_Recognition <br>
The goal of this project is to classify MNIST digits.<br>
Implemented a neural network to classify MNIST digits.<br>
##3. Collaborative Filtering <br>
